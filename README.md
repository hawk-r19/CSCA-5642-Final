# CSCA 5642 Final Project  
***

This project is a final project for my Intro to Deep Learning class. The python notebook can be run as is, as long as all required packages are installed (can be found in the imports section at the top).

## Files  
***  
- final_v4.ipynb
  - the main notebook that includes the entire modelling process and analysis
- histories/history*.json
  - the history objects storing the results of different model iterations

### Note:  
> *The data is downloaded from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jockeroika/diabetic-retinopathy/data), and is extracted to a folder named 'data' within the root directory. This is how the files are referenced in the main notebook. I did not include them in this repo due to their size.*
